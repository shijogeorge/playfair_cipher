Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique and was the first literal digram substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone.

It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment. A typical scenario for Playfair use would be to protect important but non-critical secrets during actual combat. By the time the enemy cryptanalysts could break the message the information was useless to them.

Any sequence of 25 letters can be used as a key, so long as all letters are in it and there are no repeats. Note that there is no 'j', it is combined with 'i'. We now apply the encryption rules to encrypt the plaintext.

1. Remove any punctuation or characters that are not present in the key square (this may mean spelling out numbers, punctuation etc.).

2. Identify any double letters in the plaintext and replace the second occurence with an 'x' e.g. 'hammer' -> 'hamxer'.

3. If the plaintext has an odd number of characters, append an 'x' to the end to make it even.

4. Break the plaintext into pairs of letters, e.g. 'hamxer' -> 'ha mx er'.

5. Locate the letters in the key square, (the examples given are using the key square above)

        a. If the letters are in different rows and columns, replace the pair with the letters on the same row respectively but at the other pair of corners of the rectangle defined by the original pair. The order is important â€“ the first encrypted letter of the pair is the one that lies on the same row as the first plaintext letter. 'ha' -> 'bo', 'es' -> 'il'
        
        b. If the letters appear on the same row of the table, replace them with the letters to their immediate right respectively (wrapping around to the left side of the row if a letter in the original pair was on the right side of the row). 'ma' -> 'or', 'lp' -> 'pq'
        
        c. If the letters appear on the same column of the table, replace them with the letters immediately below respectively (wrapping around to the top side of the column if a letter in the original pair was on the bottom side of the column). 'rk' -> 'dt', 'pv' -> 'vo' .
